	<p>James Meredith is a civil rights activist best known for being the first black student admited to the segregated Ole Miss. His application was initially denied, but the Supreme Court eventually ruled that it was based on race and James had the right to go to the school. On just his second day of school, despite police escorts, he was shot, but quickly recovered. James inspired several marches and played a pivotal role in desegregating schools.</p>

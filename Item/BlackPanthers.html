<p>The Black Panther Party was a highly controversial party known for being violent. The FBI went as far as to say they were "the greatest threat to the internal security of the country," and lead an illegal investigation against them. Apart from being violent, the Black Panthers were also known for social programs, including providing free meals to children, educational programs, and health clinics.</p>
